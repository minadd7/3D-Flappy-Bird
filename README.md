# 3D-Flappy-Bird

A 3D re-implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game built in Unity as a practice project for learning game development.

This project recreates the core mechanics of the original game in a 3D environment, where the player controls a bird by timing jumps to pass through obstacles and score points.

---

## Gameplay

- Press Spacebar to make the bird jump  
- Navigate through gaps between obstacles  
- Each successful pass gives +1 point  
- The goal is to survive as long as possible with precise timing  

The gameplay focuses on simple but challenging timing-based control, staying faithful to the original Flappy Bird experience.

## Built With

- Engine: Unity 6000.0.34f1 (LTS)  
- Language: C#  
- Physics: Rigidbody-based 3D physics  
- Assets: Free assets (Unity Asset Store and other free resources)

## Features

- Classic Flappy Bird mechanics in 3D  
- Spacebar-controlled jumping  
- Randomly generated obstacles  
- Score tracking (+1 for each obstacle passed)  
- Collision detection and game-over logic  
- Camera follow system

## Project Purpose

This project was created as a toy project and learning exercise to practice:

- Unity 3D workflow  
- Physics-based movement (Rigidbody)  
- Game loop logic (score, game over, restart)  
- C# scripting for gameplay systems  

It was built purely for game development practice, not for commercial release.

## Development Period

- Summer 2025

## Platform

This project was developed as a local Unity game for learning purposes.  
It could be built for WebGL or desktop platforms if needed.
